		// Demonstrates Join for merging datasets, compared to nested loops.
		// Concept: Combines two collections based on a common key.
		// Real-world Example: If you have orders and customer details separately, Join can link them together.
		// Problem Solving: Essential for combining related data from different sources, which is common in database operations.
